Friday morning: span annotation feature Done!

Fixed both the pending defects, and shipped the span annotation feature:
- the viewer had a boundary handling bug
- turns out correct in the viewer is to only look for span open/close on the
  pre-op side
- I had an off-by-one bug in how I placed the final ".spanClose" in the smm
  program

For commit detail, I refer you to the git history, as this unblocks ~39
some commits from the last couple weeks.
