Thursday morning: Fast Forward To Debugging Time!

After drawing inspirations from dreams, our hero barges forward into the fray.
While no final resolution is yet in sight, further progress on tooling is made.

- [gave up][97e1fb8e] the [1-dimensional vector array][1a7aaf86] bug-bear, back
  to a [6][3]uint32 (18 element array containing 3 tuples)
- [added routines for converting between index and x,y,z space][d8f1150c]
- added a "vec3addptr" routine, that basically adds a `*[3]uint32` to a
  `[3]uint32`
- given these, advance is as simple as: ["vec3addptr"][8eebcc5e] under ["i2xyz"][8eebcc5e]
- [added collision detection][7c5b6f3c]

Then I finally started trynig to run the beast for the first time:
- NPE panic! hooray!
  - well you see, `TestCase.Result` isn't optional...
  - ...there wasn't even a `NoResult` for it to default to...
  - ...now there is, and it does.
- plus I generalized the expected halt codes feature from `Results`, so now you
  can say `Result: NoResult{}.WithExpectedHaltCodes(1, 2, 3)` for example.
- the [snake test][040dd39c] then ["passed"][2e4580bf] on all 4 of my first randomly generated snakes!
- I had to [extend the loop][702654d3] to [the 7th one][bb49a6ce] before I got a non-pass...
- ...however I also don't say "failure", since "non-pass" actually means "non-halt" ;-)

All of that "x/test" improvements mentioned above are now on master, go looking
there for details if you want. Also be sure to get latest master for maximum
embetterment.

So tomorrow it's time to really dig into that 7th one that looks like it may be
a solvable snake out of my generator, but inducing my stackvm program to never
halt! By which I mean, the real focus will be on the vm architecture and
tooling to protect against and trivialize debugging this case.
