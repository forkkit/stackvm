Wednesday morning: Naming Outputs, Naming Inputs, But First: Strings Please?

Started a new line of work; wouldn't it be nice if when you write:
```
".out", "foo:", ".alloc", 8
```

That we could pass the name `"foo"` all the way down to the machine, so that
later on (in the trace log viewer) rather than stare at:
```
values=[[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]]
```

You could instead have:
```
values=[foo:[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]]
```

Well, to get there:
- first, we don't even have any notion of working with strings at all yet
  - we at least need to be able to [fetch them within a machine][ac16a062]
  - the assembler needs to be [able to represent static strings][61e24fcc]
  - and sure, I guess the [user should be able to add arbitrary static strings][4a3f5b9]
  - TODO: finish out this sub line of work first, by adding UTF-8 encode/decode
    operations, and something like a rot13 test for #allthatjazz
- from the other end of the problem [regions should be namable][73d44b06]
- to wire the two together:
  - we'll need a [new name option][f45eeec7]
  - which the [assembler can then use to name in/out regions][f06b4f3e]

Then we can have the happy problem of leveraging named values better in the
trace logger and its viewer.
