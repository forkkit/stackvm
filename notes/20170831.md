Thursday morning: Bugs, Time, and Grinding

While I did finish through a first (and second iteration!) crack at
[implementing utf8 encode/decode ops][d3cd2796], and a [rot13-styled test for
them][158b7df9], I ultimately chose to punt that line of work to a side-branch,
and get back to the output naming feature I started out chasing.

I thought that would be simple... but when testing it, I found that I'd put a
bug in master back when I'd added alloc tokens... so back in time I went about
2 days, [pulled forward and fixed the alloc token work][2b63cb3b].

While trying to debug through failures in the new feature, I realized that the
only test I had that used ".out" is the send-more-money test. So I made [a more
targeted in-N-out test first][b206f9b7]. Having that test, I felt comfortable
enough to merge some [refactoring work][e362923c] that will let us eventually
add the user api for getting named values.

So the bug revealed by the test turned out to be an assembler bug, due to
things being too simple:
- previously outputs got handled like "drop a ref when we start one"...
- when we end one (usually implicitly by a next label) flush that pending
  reference as an output...

That was okay, but my attempt to add names was too simple at first:
- when flushing, first emit a nameLabel and string...
- ... the nameLabel used later to reference the string in an option
- then emit the ending / next label as normal

Well that has the obvious (in retrospect) bug of putting the entire string
contents inside the declared region itself! So at this point, we have Choices:
- I could add a whole new "strings section" and place the strings there...
- ...but that's not very elegant (altho we may do it someday for perf Reasons)
- instead [let's just (always) synthesize a proper ending label and add it][327e00aa]
- then we can just add the name right after the region, so the binary still
  looks like "...values name..." rather than "...name......values..." which
  makes debugging easier, and just feels more stack-y.

While named outputs is now passing the inNout test, there's still no test that
actually leverages/covers the naming feature itself (said test still uses the
old positional form). Next up:
- change that, support named outputs in x/test
- ...test them with the inNout test
- ...then develop named inputs
- ...and also test them with inNout
