Friday morning: Groundhog Day: Bits again, now with more Win

The ghost of yesterday waylays our protagonist, but some progress is made
nonetheless.

So tests were broken by even the most basic "drop loop ops" commit from
yesterday. It turns out the problem was I had accidentally removed the
`Mach.step` cases for `"call"` and `"ret"` too... oops... well [now
it's][1899e91a] [much easier][62cb6ca6] [to see that][a8cf0baf] [in a test
failure][8ae0f1f3].

Right, so now for real: [unimplement][f50bbf30] and [undefine][9e21d881] the
loop ops, [then][8732ed65] [cleanup][7600a072]. And [make a note][b7db62eb]
that we really need to re-think that whole `Mach.step` switch ordering.

Of course the [`"nop"`][a4fb86ac] op, and [bit ops][29a48e51] from yesterday
are nearly unchanged (altho I did add a nop test for maximum awesome).

I decided to drastically simplify the space of possible bit operations, and to
[indulge in a round of cute naming][0cb96761]:
- `"bitest"` tests a bit in a bit vector, it takes on addr immediate, and reads
  the bit offset from the stack, leaving a boolean 0/1 in its place.
- `"bitset"` sets a bit in a bit vector, with the same addr immediate, followed
  by nth bit convention; it (OOPS should!) consume n from the stack
- `"bitsot"` clears a bit in a bit vector, with the same addr immediate,
  followed by nth bit convention; it (OOPS should!) consume n from the stack

Since these are some of the least trivial ops, they really do [make me wish I
could inline document operetars][2e9a1b07].

Next up:
- [OOPS I messed up the stack return semantics of `"bitset"` and
  `"bitost"`][b4a2e098] and didn't even realize it until writing this update!
- self-documenting op definitions: An Idea Whose Time Has Come
- use bit vector ops in send-more-money
