Friday morning: Not Sure If; Back To The Data Mine!

Our protagonist, being shrewd and reflective, starts to suspect his tools more
than the actual tactics, ad so leaves the fight to first improve them.

Since it's much more likely that I have a banal error around building or using
my manually crafted data sections... let's stop that first before really diving
into debugging.

- [added code generation for opCodeXXXs][59ac2763]
  - since I've planned to redefine op code 0 to be a nil-adic control op other
    than push (noop? halt?)
  - since there's a good many TODOs about adding missing ops
  - this makes iterating on the ISA as easy as updating the ops array and the
    vm step dispatch
- [added a unit test][b5ad8e8c] for invalid op codes; always a good idea, but a
  machine encountering this is now much more likely once we make data Easy â„¢.
- you know what's better than making op code 0 be `"noop"` or `"halt"`?
  [defining an entirely new `"crash"`, that's what!][b8ab0e99]
- that done, I choose to reduce a debatably "silly" [rejection to load empty
  programs to be just a runtime crash][d647490f] (first some [prep][063c8c5c])

Great now we crash when jumping into undefined memory rather than infinite
(technically it should have been finite until a stack overflow) `0, "push"`s or
nop-sledding forever.

This further improves my plans to use the "hack" that:
- since op code 0 is nil-adic...
- ...then I can use op code 0 with an arg for internal signalling in the
  assembler
- ...which means that I can avoid adding an entire extra layer of structures to
  deal with encodig data, maintaining and resolving references into it, and
  such

In fact, it's nots so improved that I don't even consider it a "hack":
- [the api now hard refuses to resolve such operations][9582e59c], should the
  user try to say `42, "crash"` in a program (similarly the more likely `2,
  "neg"` or `0xbeef, "ret"`)
- even if all that fails, and we somehow encode a with-arg crash...
  - ...and even if the vm would try to execute it somehow (it won't, it's a
    decode error currently)
  - ...then it'll just crash anyhow, since we're not using a noop or more
    mundane halt operation
- the protocol of "this is what we're doing here" is [now collected into two
  utility functions, and documented][cf89854c]

Next up:
- [actually allow data references][52b02f9a] to be used as op args
- allow refs to take an offset immediate (immediates can have immediates?! at
  least any `":ref"` that's in a `".data"` section can...)
- prove all this in the established ["send + more = money" test][bbb1b462]
- [reduce the tedium of typing N-many `0, `s][363aeb67] WIP: alloc for data
- at least update the todo with thoughts on [string theory][ccd06ed8]
