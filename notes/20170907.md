Thursday morning: multi-root viewer, and fixed a parsing bug

The trace log viewer now supports viewing logs with more than one root machine
(e.g. my snake poc test that uses sub test-cases):
- the frontend data model now support changing the root and limits the listed
  result links to the current root
- there's now a select box to change root, hidden if there's only one
- url state now encodes the current root using a `#rootID` tag and also sets
  the root for the prior `#rootID(parentID:machID)` tag that still causes the
  table to show
- final [commit for reference][99bf4e25], chase its parent commits for
  preparatory details

After that, I [fixed the quoted string parsing bug][32a06d0c] that was
manifesting as things like `err="run` instead of `err="run queue full"` in the
tracelog links table.

Next I'll either:
- cycle back to the snake support lib, and unit test it
- dirve down the rabbit hole of actually grokking it trace log
