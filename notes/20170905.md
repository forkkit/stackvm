Extended weekend roundup / Tuesday morning: Named Inputs, Named Value Tracing, and Includes!

I finall cycled back into the snake problem briefly this mornings, Progress!

First off I finished off named inputs:
- [machine can now take name options to input regions][b8f62156]
- [assembler follow suit][06d381f6]
- [new user NamedInput build option][6b239f80]
- [x/test takes advantage][b8725a9c]
- [inNout now uses it][53fb98d6]

Next I started down the path of "use it in trace logs":
- [tracelog][f3645373] [parsing is][2432464f] [now vastly][e5e5bbe8] [improved][92117474]
- [tracelog sessions now have key-vals][32ee61cd] [rather than fixed values][5e9ab735]

Next up, the tracer learned to emit named values:
- [once machine][d0392e25] [better supported][1bfae870] [output introspection][17709e09]
- [basic change to write named values][4b882f98]
- [also at beginning][d0e93021]
- and for bonus, now [store ops][b208bb6e] [will be annotated][76e8dd1c] things
  like `out_foo[9]=42` after a store into a named array

Next I drastically improved the tracelog viewer; too many commits (51) to
really get into the details, but here are the broad strokes:

- add a header to the log table
- drastically improved record assembly:
  - pre-ops are no longer shown (unless you're debugging the machine itself,
    you probably don't care)
  - copy entries are now augmented into their succesor ops (e.g. you seee a
    `child=` or `parent=` annotation on a normal op, rather than a `Copy` line)
  - suppress re-begin records
  - all of tho un-munged records are now available by addin an additional
    `#raw` url hash tag
- added an entire framework for functionally formatting values for the new
  pretty log view; used it, e.g. so that all hex numbers get minimally padded,
  and to consistently strip/not-add `0x` prefixes
  - one of the benefits of this lovely new framework, is we upgraded to html
    formatting (not just text) allowing to add child/parent links
- page nav expanded to support multiple tags, e.g. `#1(2:3)#raw`
- log table's lifecycle matured: update is now separate from showing
- **switched** to SCSS, bundled by rollup
  - intermediate assets are now `sunburst.rollup.js` and `sunburst.rollup.css`
  - works by just ES6 `import "./my.scss"` in your js; all such-included
    fragments then go into the css bundle
  - in retrospect, I should've went with postcss, but switching over in the
    future should be Easy â„¢
- use the [HSLuv](www.hsluv.org) SCSS module
  - contrast differences are now much more consistent, as expected
  - side note: the fact that HUSL renamed to HSLuv since last I looked is just
    flat out awesomeness 2.0
  - TODO: when reading up on postcss, I encounted the [HWB color space][hwb];
    should evaluate that
- added long overdue counts to nav, like # machines, # ops
  - [corollary, the hierarchy is now valued by # ops][e31eb8c9] , machines arcs
    are now meritocratically sized, rather than arbitrary "everyone gets a 1"
- goal decoration learned to stop midway through a record table, after an
  on-path machine has forked off the rest of the goal path
- clicking on the bound (off-arc) now activates the currently seleceted path;
  this makes trying to click tiny arcs possible

Finally (Tuesday morning) I got back onto the snake problem; So Much To Do:
- well right off the bat, my impulse is "gee, that's alot of library coed, I
  wish I could test it"...
- so the [assembler sprouted a state stack][20dbfed6]
- which lets it implement an [include directive][6ce6f212]
- of course [smm uses it for coverage][88ec9313]
- this is the perfect place for someone else to weld a **module system** onto ;-)
