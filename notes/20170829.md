Tuesday morning: Assembler Tokens, Much Improve Vis, and Time Travel

Finished out a side branch I've been carrying along for a bit now:
- assembler use to do all its internal handoff between scanner and encoder thru
  the `stackvm.Op` structure, by dint of hacking "data token" into a zero
  varcode (which cannot have an argument as either an option code or op code)
- no more, now the assmbler has its own [`token` struct, that embeds
  `stackvm.Op`][a8eaf502]; this greatly simplify many prior special cases, to
  now be a clear dispatch on token kind
- as a bonus, the ".alloc" directive can now be [directly represented as a
  token][0cfe39ee], rather than N-many data tokens

While iterating on the tracelog vis, I refactored the way [rollup is
configured][e419bd87], [ran for generation][e77f54f3], and [ran for
watch][12275fab].

The visualization is now fastly improved:
- goals afforded in the trail
- deep linking to machine ids is now a thing; doing so causes the page to load
  with the table shown
- all end states are categorized by "values" vs err string, and a list of links
  is shown in upper right
- shifted to a single-hue blue pallete...
- ...then reclaimed green to mean "goal path"
- factored out a [`RecordAssambler`][ff98b5b5] (oops sp, will fix that going forward)...
- ...then [greatly generalized extra field handling][7e5ddd48] (used to hide
  [stack address noise][87fa2e98])

I also got to the bottom of the allocs performance regression:
- it wasn't broken freelisting as suspected...
- ...it as somehow caused by the debug logging added to the assesmbler.
- I figured this out by bisecting, so I haven't actually explained why the
  debug logs had this effect
- so I went back ~7 days and ~97 commits ago, and made assembler debug log
  feature never have been; I've isolated a ported-forward version of it to a
  pocket branch in case I need it again.

Interestingly, all that time travel only invalidated 8 commit trees, altho of
course all of those prior ~97 commits are now in danger of becoming dangling
links in prior status updates... I wonder if I can fix that with more
dev-blogging tooling going forward...
