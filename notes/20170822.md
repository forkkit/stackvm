Tuesday morning: First Class Entry

More iterating on the assembler, plus we now have a "machine builder":
- the assembler now has an internal "section" struct, leaving more hope for the future
  - it came [out of the prog][8b05482b]
  - for immediate [re-use for options][71bf9747]

I ended up needing to debeg the assemble so much, that I made that A Thingâ„¢:
- can now [insantiate][6c6aad58] an assembler [with options][edcf0171]
- there's [a `Logf` option][d2c30f08] that will cause [debug logging][e7e47ee8]
- via a [test flag][ef1a470e]

I explicated an [encoder out of the assembler][e46080ae], the assemble is now
basically:
- scan generic data into sections
- collect those sections together into one op stream
- encode that op stream

Especially so once I realized that [labels go in sections][4d730516] too
(perhaps more obvious post hoc).

Having laid all that pipe, the ".entry" directive [is now no longer a "jump
hack"][ebecc6d4].

While [iterating on the collatz test][60789613], I made the encoder learn to
[fail if it hasn't resolved all refs][1e47c5be] (oops).

Since options are about to get a bit more stateful (an output range option is
semantically a pair of two atomic option), I had to do something:
- now there's a [`machBuilder`][e5360064]
- with its option [handling][9bbcd0c9] and [reading][6ceeeb8e] factored out for
  re-use

Setting the stage for stacic output ranges:
- `Mach.Values` [won't fail while running anymore][aafe4ce5]
- and the conext can now [carry additional output ranges][4bde95ab]
