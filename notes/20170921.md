Thursday morning: perf regression resolution, nearly done!

Turns out the perf regression was a slipped debug logf in the assembler. Sadly
it alrady made it into yesterday's release, so retconning its fix invalidates
some of yesterdays's commit ids; oops.

For that sort of rason primarily, I'm not releasing anymore code to master
today, until I really finish through:
- investigating the internal perf tradeoffs of the SMM refactors done to
  temporarily have an interesting call structure
- reducing sources of assembler allocs (i.e. it looks like the `refsBy
  map[string][]ref`'s time has passed)
- actually looking at any of this new span output in the tracelog viewer and
  verifying it

As it turns out, the thing that makes the assembler debug log slow is the
`interface{}` allocations around using the `logf`-style api. I'll probably swap
all internal logging out for zap soon-ish, mostly to stop the adhoc parsing
game, but yeah also beacuse #faster...
