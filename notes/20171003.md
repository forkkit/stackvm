Tuesday morning: a bit of progress, and a bit of a hack,

Managed to get half-readable spans out of the snake traces, mostly by manually
annotating all function opens. This will probably continue to be necessary
until we have some sort of control flow analysis to detect them.

While debugging my way where:
- made the raw table [show JSON values][a516f6c3]
- afforded [spanClose debugging][6bc06a2c]
- clarified [assembler scanner state lifecycle][0c67390c]
  - added a [guard within for unclosed spans][9e403614]
- [moved scanner state][4cd70c71] [around a bit][a43d1862]

Tomorrow: what the heck is up with that snake trace?!?
