Tuesday morning: the bugs nature starts to reveal itself

No resolution yet, but now the formerly opaque / silent failure is more
transparent: it's just as simple as "the encoder's output buffer isn't large
enough, and we're truncating machine code". Why is unclear as yet, however the
encoder now catches this case and fails loudly, rather than creating a program
that will eventually crash:

- [structified the encoder output state][95b3e7ce] to allow decomposing the One
  Large Method
- factored out the twice-used ["encode one token" logic into an `encodeTok`
  method][da6b0b03]
- [added a space check to `encodeTok`][ede55e30] so that if we run out of
  space, we fail loudly
- [check for, the as yet impossible, `tok.EncodeInto` failure][6d606eed]
- finally [make the varcode builder fail if it gets truncated][464356ce]

So now the failure is bounded to:
- in the SMM problem, we start adding span annotations to column sections
- we're okay through the first 3 columns (dey, nre, and eon)
- but as soon as we add the 4th column span (the smo column) the encoder gets
  truncated

Obviously we're underestimated the `maxBytes` metric used to allocate the
encoder's buffer. But why and is this a new defect (e.g. in all of the new
label renaming shenanigans on dev), or has this always been a possible
eventually buried in the encoder? Only time will tell!

I did try the obvious crib of "how about you try disabling that fancy
renaming?", but it didn't fully resolve the failure...
