Weekend roundup / Monday morning: Towards A Bold New ".entry" And Moar ".result"s

Wrapped up the bit vector work
- vector ops are now [A Thing][04c5616f]
- using them [in `send + more = money`][6d7bb286]
- pointed out that [atomic variants][e52c3a17] [are also useful][32c07c64]

FWIW bit vector ops turned out to be another ~20% speed improvement for smm,
bringing it down to ~1ms/op.

Next up, I stared back in on the `snake_poc`, and realized that I really wanted
a better way to demarcate result regions:
- currently it's an implicit and dynamic protocol after sucessful halt
- but really I want the tracer to be able to pluck intermediate values out at any time
- most (all?) programs don't even need the dynimac noture of the current result
  protocol; their results are a fixed property of their program shape

So set out to make it so that we can write things like:

```
".data",
".result", "things:", ".alloc", 5,

".text",
// do something that fills in :things
0, "halt",
```

But it actually takes quite a lot to get there:
- the only other such directive `".entry"` is curently a bit of a hack that
  adds a jump operation, whose offset gets filled in normally
- there's currently no support for options whose value is an address resolved
  at encode time

However, since I recently made options be encoded as "just varcodes" they're
closer than ever to being "load time opcodes", so let's fast forward to that future:

- refactored and minimized api surface: now you [just pass a handler][a3e01306]
  and program to `New()`; there's no more `SetHandler` or
  [`SetQueueSize`][9d92cb23] methods
- [improved docs][82986762], including [code generation for ergonomics][3b844ef4]
- [added `.queueSize`  directive][510e89fc]
- [added `.maxCopis` directive][81e05b0a]
- [assemlbing test programs can now be deferred][9463264f]; this makes
  debugging assemble time problems much easier, and generally makes it so that
  the tests do less when `-run` limited.
- options are now encoded in-situ:
  - by adding to a slice of "option ops"
  - theese are then combined with the regular "program ops" at encode time
  - far too many commits to really get into here, look back at history or the
    current code base for more

I didn't quite get it working for [even `".entry"`][5bc5bdac] yet tho, let
alone [add `".result"`][00c7b15e]; that's where I'll pickup tomorrow.

For a bonus round, this same mechanism will be an easy way to demarcate input
data regions, not just the priorly used output data regions.
