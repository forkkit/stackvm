Tuesday morning: Grinding Out A Few Levels

Having lost too many recent battles, our protagonist returns to the desert to
grind out a few levels.

Rather than add YAFWF (Yet Another Fixed Width Field):
- [Factored out][8e8a0191] [varcode][e9dbca63] [encoding routines][984ea345]
- [Factor out the over-due readMachOptions][c10d742f]
- [use varcoding to encode][0674d443] [version][0080496c], [stackSize][f7a1a2b0], and [maxOps][c74fc784]
- rather than this prior [sillyness][9473f6ca]

When further considering adding a maxForks option, I realized:
- it'd be best added in the context level...
- ...to deny allocation of new machines
- [oops, well I can't do that yet][5b037b22]
- but hey, pools have always been needlessly slow, [let's move beyond that][38b8be18]

But to get there, I need to make [context more compositional][eb0f9fbe] in the
first place; this is a neat example of a pattern I've rarely used so far in Go:
a struct that exists only to embde N-many small interfaces.

Next up:
- finish out the freelist business, benchmark it
- implement max{Allocs,Copies,Forks} #namingishard
- maybe add some other options like a default queue size, and further decouple
  setting a handler from setting the queue size
- maybe finally do parallel machine execution now taht the context type is
  feeling more solid to support that sort of thing, i.e.:
  - a higher level queue that suppors stealing between N-many runqs each with
    their own dedicated goroutine
  - can snip the global pool, and maybe pool hierarchically above freelists in
    similar way...
