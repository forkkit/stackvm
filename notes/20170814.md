Monday morning: Closer, But No Dice

Eased back into the `snake_poc` branch:
- [dropping the old stacksize declaration][0481a996]
- and [upgrading the entry point declaration][30ea98ea]
- next the obvious bit of [declaring vectors directly][bc96f187]
- likewise, [carve out occupied space][9fdbc582]
- and [carve out choice space][bc419f84]
- but oh wait, did you notice that bug? [I hadn't before!][a4a6b40d]

Well shit, now not even the first case is halting (recall prior it halted with
no found result, "passing" my primitive test setup).

Okay so it's time to finally bring in a vm-supported limiting mechanism to
prevent against obvious pathology:
- [added a new `.maxOps N` directive][dec3bf0f]
- wow, adding new directives and options is now super easy!
  - [even if it points out that I "need" to invent an "encdoing protocol" for MachOptions that supports optional fields...][636a25fe]

Anyhow, [use that feature in `snake_poc`][3aead65b] but it still halts. I think
that means that it's fork bombing...

Next up:
- add a `.maxForks` limit similar to `.maxOps`, but the execution context will
  probably have to get in on the implementation
- I'm getting insipired to implement randomized search, so I'd probably fall
  back on my "send + more = money" canon to prove that out... I'm thinking of:
  - vm-special operation for "rand uint32" and "rand-up-to-end"
  - the operation would implement some PRNG from the PCG family with the `C`
    value unique to every machine instance so that copies generate differing
    sequences
- other frontier care-and-feeding mechanisms, useful for cases that don't lend
  themselves to exhaustion...
- ...which may bleed into memory page flags
- I'd like to build out other more accessible examples (searches that don't
  require geospatial intuition to grok and/or or generators that bulid pretty
  images) towards the brown bag demo coming up in two weeks

So in short: I'm almost certainly going to abandon my snake cube PoC for now,
shifting back into more of an explicit pipe-laying and exploration mode. Likely
that when I cycle back to the snake problem, I'll probably just scrap my
current poc and start over again. All that said, debugging thru this current
broken poc is likely to be fruitful insomuch as the tooling I have to build
along the way... it's hard to say...
