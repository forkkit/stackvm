Weekend roundup / Monday morning: Shipped tracelog sunburst

Taking a side journy into frontend-landia to greatly improve tracelog viewing.


Further abstracted tracelog [session writing][7c147b96], especially key support
[closing them][692d200f]. This is especially key because it will later let
easily add "on cloes" behavior, like "open a browser on that temp file" or
"start a develompnt web server".

Made the tracelog JSON output more scannable by [putting each record on its own
line][59e5fb47].

Finised out the visualization used in the Friday demo:
- javascript asset building ala using [rollup][95770d4d]
- template smashing ala [html-inline] [b7f103c1]
- template complide in use [go-bindata][f879fd52]
- use that for a news [`tracelog -html` mode][f328f077]

Then to make life easier:
- added [`tracelog -web` mode][d230226d] which just opens file in a browser
- added [`tracelog -web-dev` mode][95f5d58b] which spawn rollup in watch mode,
  and hosts un-smashed assets on an http server

Given my new -web-dev ability:
- simplify the [focus implementation][5c604858]
- and added [goal marking][828a7c9f]

Next I went a bit ES6-crazy:
- [model is now a thing][51731509]
- [so is the trail][5e606f6f]
- [and the chart][efc79220]
- [and the log table][bf72f6a8]
- [and even the synthesis of the 3][e203d857]
- [stop using objects for Maps][a6ed9de9]

Next up I wanted to collapse the log table records. Since, unless you're trying
to debug the vm implementation itself, you probabyl don't care about the
"pre-operation" state. As a program author, you pretty much only care about the
effet of each operation (or its "post-operation" state). While I didn't
actually get collapsing to a place where I'm ready to ship it yet, the table
does now [show stack values more clearly][443e28af], and isn't as clutter by
[redundant parent/child info][170c91c0] that's already in the trail and table
id column.

Next steps:
- finish out record collapsing
- use this to debug my snake implementation, using that use cas to force next
  features, such as:
  - a zooming behavior
  - a search behavior
  - integrating memory dumps
