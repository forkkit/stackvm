Friday morning: Named Outputs Done, Inputs Started

Tested, debugged, and finished named outputs:
- [regions can now carry a name address][37552fd9]
- [use that to implement a new output name option][32fa3fb8]
- [the assembler now has string tokens][47c4b78d]
- [which are used to encode the label name of each output into the binary][c3086e5b]
- [added internal machine string fetching support][b3b2fed9]
- [add a new NamedValues api that returns a map][f9f79f53]
- [generalized test result values][0dbff833]
- [use that in inNout test][8ded9c5b]

I almost finished through a similar track for inputs; the code is "complete"
but the test doesn't pass.

Next up:
- finish named inputs
- consider rebuilding the dynamic output contract to be more explicit and/or
  support naming
