Wednesday morning: improved tracing, towards multi-root viewer

Not much finished progress today; back on the topic of "debug the snake poc":
- when we last left off with snake, we had 3 cases that "pass" (failing to find
  a solution) and a 4th that blows out its self-imposed 1000 copy limit (it
  otherwise doesn't halt with higher limits either)
- whether or not I have a mundane bug in its support code that testing will
  reveal, I want to be able to look at the trace data as it is today
- that turned out to be painful with the trace logs mixed up in actual test
  output; the testing seems to double print some Logf lines in "interesting"
  ways when the test fails
- so I [added -stackvm-test.traceTo FILE][d5bbed6b], now [supported by tracelog][c10fbb3b]
- a further problem holding us back here was that every test started numbering
  machines from 1, mixing up their logs anyhow; [so now the id tracer is
  shared][1de3d7ba]
- while in the room I improved [tracer][c02a1a60] [plumbing][3c69b1db]

I got about 80% of the way through teaching the sunburst frontend code to
handle multiple roots with a select box dropdown, but it's not done yet;
tomorrow!
