Monday morning: chasing the snake again

Started chasing snake, hit difficulties leveraging the new span annotation feature:
- added span annotations to the main path
- looked at the output: most are being marked red or unrecognized
- suspect something's going on with spans X library include

Improved the tracelog go program
- so that you can [pass it a filename][5c45390a]
- and so that it [prints out status][2157c254] (to un-confuse parsing large output, like from snake)

Tomorrow:
- go back to SMM, factor out a function library, prove spans out there
- maybe back on snake again...
