Wednesday morning: Freelist rather than Pool, 20% faster

Our hero wins a small small victory, granting a 20% speed buff!

Spent too much time chasing down a bug in yesterdays work:
- the bug only happened when tracing is enabled, and for a non-trivial test
  that actually forks
- this doesn't happen automatically, so I didn't notice the bug yesterday...
- ...until a banal bug today caused tracing to engage in this case


The problem was in the newly factored `fixTracer` function from yesterday:
- my abundance of caution comparison was failing, due to trying to compare
  uncomparable interface values
- this was because we were passing machTrace by value
- that's [easily fixed][10c6ec6d] tho

All that said, the [final tip from yesterday][0034a38c], decomposing `context`
into `queue` an `Handler`, then reifying `context`, now fully works!

Then I refactor many thing around:
- [factor out][f1d167a7] and [use Mach.init][227d20c4]
- allocation is [now contextual too][3f958024]
- moved [queue size setting around][6ae8649c] and [away from x/test][ab2cec45];
  this sets the stage to add an assembled option for queue size

That gate achieved, I added a [pair of freelist allocators][b04ab3db] and [set
them up along side the `runq`][d9cce6b1]. Benchmark shows that this is ~20%
faster than the pool:

Before (pooled allocators):
```
BenchmarkMach_send_more_money-8   	    1000	   1597308 ns/op	   66087 B/op	      63 allocs/op
```

After: (freelist allocators):
```
BenchmarkMach_send_more_money-8   	    1000	   1299702 ns/op	   68109 B/op	      84 allocs/op
```

For a bonus round, I [added default allocators][8955c3d1] (one that always
allocate, no re-use), and [default to them][13ee02ce] instead of the [, now
gone, pool allocators][03745399]. When we explore parallel execution, we can
then consider if a shared re-use pool is even useful, and buil it as a
fault-through on top of local lock-less freelists if necessary.

This is about the same, or even better, than the ~15% faster that pooling is
than not even re-using anything at all. Here's the numbers for the default
allocators:

```
BenchmarkMach_send_more_money-8             1000           1886198 ns/op         1053058 B/op      10486 allocs/op
```
