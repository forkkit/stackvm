Friday morning: faster assembler, now what?

Started working with the tracelog viewer with the new span-annotated smm data.
Until I work through that, not releasing any more code to master, but I
continue to believe that I'm getting closer and closer:
- refactored the assembler to do far less allocations, by changing how refs are
  tracked during scan; while I could port this out ahead of the span work, I'm
  choosing to not spend time doing so presently.
- started refactoring the assembler so that you can just say `".entry",
  ".spanOpen", "my_thing:"` rather than needing to invent a separate entry
  label for the same position as in `".entry", "main:", ".spanOpen",
  "my_thing:"`.

I'm 80% certain that I have all I need to finish up just in the viewer now, but
the 20% uncertainty comes from:
- SMM uses a lot of double-nested spans that open at different sites, but whose
  close is a single site; I think I can recover this from the labels, since
  that single close site is labeled as both an "A close" and a "B close".
- maybe I don't have enough data to properly handle tails calls, but I think I
  can do with the signal of "the control stack didn't budge when we entered
  that new span, so it replaces / extends the prior."
