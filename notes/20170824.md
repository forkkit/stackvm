Thursday morning: input, and better trace logging

Having conquered the great Input/Output beast, our hero moves on from Mount
Options to the higher point of Mount Observability.

Input now works:
- [the workig option][71e264ad]
- [the ".in" directive][eef8fbac]
- [support in TestCase][510928c5]
- [using it in the collatz test][a4b19987]

Then I turned by gaze to the languishing tracelog tool:
- [upleveled key-val parsing][57592b57]
- [rectified session parentage][a7cb7019]

One of my original motivations for adding `".out"` was so that I could extract
emerging values at any time from a machine to aid debugging programs. Now the
tracer uses that to [log values at copy points][4a41ea7e].

Then back on tracelog bluff:
- the eternal topic of [error passing][5378d8b6]
- [factoring some][e1f52a2a] [things apart][2b435a16]
- so that [adding JSON output is straightforward][a092e08a]

Next up: using the new JSON output to build a visualization to aid demoing.
