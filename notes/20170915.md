Friday morning: call/ret span open/close working... tail calls too?

Working-ish in dev, not yet on master until I resolve the last 5% "-ish" ;-)

My confusion around halts getting labeled turned out to be:
- stop adding generic open/close annotation in every tracer log...
- ...instead only annotate spanCloses on pre-ops (before advancing IP)
- ...only annotate spanOpens on post-ops (after advancing/jumping IP)

Having done that, another complication popped up: tail-calls!

Prior we'd only been detecting explicit "call"s in traces; now, any label
that's the target of any call gets marked as a span open! For SMM that means
that the markUsed routine is now annotated as an open beneath choose!

To help exploit this feature, I decided to add `opName=%s` annotations to all
pre/post ops. That way the frontend can do a "open that is/isn't a call" logic
without parsing apart the larger action string.

Need to finish all that out, but the prototype is looking promising. Then
laying on directives to allow manual span open/close annotations will be fairly
trivial.
