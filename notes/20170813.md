Weekend roundup: A Study in Cohesion or: "What even is 'simple'?"

TL;DR: data is now A Thing, declaring it and referencing it (with offsets too!)

ALSO: the canonical `0x40` stack size hack is no longer a thing:
- [it now defaults to a `0x40` stack][2b6480ce]
- plus [you can say `".stackSize", N` to customize][6d8f8292]
- now [no longer constrained to page multiples][97e34426]

So here's how the assembler used to work:
- `Assemble(...interface{})` -- this is where the old options hack lived...
- ...then `tokenize()` validated the `[]interface{}` and built a `[]token`
- ...then `assemble()` parses the `[]token`
  - first it collects:
    - a `labels` map of name-to-index
    - a `jumps` list-of-indices of ops which reference labels
    - and a `ops` list-of-ops, being all of the parsed operations; this list
      where all those indices are relative to
  - then it does Stuff ™ with `jumps` and `ops` to setup a `jumpCursor`...
  - the cursor points at the next jump whose ref has yet to be resolved, so that...
  - then it can do a rewindable loop over `ops`, encoding each into a `[]byte`

Right, so if you've been counting, that's at least something like 3 passes over
the same fundamental data. And that final encoding pass is really A Bit Much;
I'm not sure if it's quadratic exactly, but suspect it may be at least so in
some pathological worst case...

Anyhow the real difficulty kept coming as I was trying to add More Than Just
Ops (aka Data ™) to all this. Adding offseted-references was proving especially
Fun ™. While achievable the task was really showing:
- the loop in `tokenize` and the primary/first/easy loop in `assemble` were
  basically the same thing; complexity that one needs, must be mirrored in the
  other
- that pile of `jumpCursor` business was really getting fragile, let alone that
  it says "jump" but now we want strictly more than just "jump"s (Data Refs!)

Well, I got there! Now we have:
- `Assemble()` now just sets up and runs an internal `assembler struct`
  - it first calls `assembler.scan()`
  - and then `assembler.encode()`
- `assembler.scan` is basically:
  - a fused version of the prior tokenizer and assemble first-pass
  - with no intermdiate `token` type anymore; `interface{}` simply becomes
    State ™ now
  - plus much of the Stuff ™ previously done to make a `jumpCursor` is now done
    in passing by the scan, building up a much more obvious `[]ref` where `ref`
    is basically a pair of `site` and `targ` indices, along with an `off`set
- `assembler.encode` then is as good as it gets devoid of deeper changes
  - there's no more `jumpCursor` to also worry about
  - it's just inlined seeking on that `[]ref` to drive maybe-rewindning the
    encoding process

I'm not actually going to link a whole lot of commits here, since there's like
90 to choose from... go checkout history in git, it's a good time ;-)

Some highlights:
- [I did add a cute mod-10 test][f5a9ce70]
- here's what it looks like in "send + more = money"
  - [basic "just data"][33e70c8c]
  - [sugar for all those zeros][b9b126be]
- [oh look][2a9d6630], we have `".entry"` directives now
- [several][49e4b1d1] [minor][be1f7c54] [cleanups][968df81d] [in][c7e53607] [random][bd7eec00] bits
- [answering the big questions][3b754870]
- [here's][2d512991] [what][9415f3e6] [some][dbb07d48] [of][8d55b0d7] [the][e52a3858] new handler things look like
- [now refs][d6d15e6c] [can have][92d9adac] [offets][7709360e]

Next up:
- back to the snake problem, I'll update my solution using the new shiny
- then I wat to solve other problems to get more examples built out, so I may
  not spend much time on snake if it proves sticky
