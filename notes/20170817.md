Thursday morning: Bit Ops

Heartened by recent payoffs in leveling up, our protagonist continues to grind
in the desert:
- [added a default to Mach.step][2ae8149c] so that it's possible to define an
  opCode, but leave it unimplemented
- [dropped the oddball loop operations][71a8a98e]; may bring them back in a
  future round, but it's not clear that they're useful
- [wrote done a note][63e30290] that we really should re-structure the dispatch
  priorities in Mach.step
- added the long overdue [nop op][0b026ad5]
- added even longer overdue [bitwise ops][41d95c14]
- started working on [bit vector ops][787dfb78] (naming is hard... I wanted to
  have "bitest" and "bitset" for maximum lols... but providing proper coverage
  on the "which part is immediate" question proved more imporntant...)

Next up:
- finish out the bit vector ops, switch smm to them, bench
- random operation, probably called `"rand"`
- `"fcall"`/`"bcall"` ops are probably coming soon; I suspect some problems are
  easier to implement if you can be like:
  - "fork call this function, but also let's try not first"
  - or "branch call this function, but let's not if that doesn't work out"
- as may be a simple "copy" operation, which might be speculatively useful in a
  "rand"om world
- don't forget to add `".maxCopies"` directive to help debug the `snake_poc`
- add a `".queueSize"` directive

Probably somewhere around `"fcall"` and/or `"rand"` I'll stop grinding and go
back to solving existing and new problems, or generating things.
