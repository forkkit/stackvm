Wednesday morning: output, and almost input!

An air of progress settles in around our adventurer.

The [output option][facfa4f9] and [".out" directive][027a2704] is now
[working in the smm test][b42a5c27].

Then defined [input option][cba1c907] and [".in" directive][22023777] and
almost got a [use case][229caa28] done to start testing.

The thorny part with input, and why I didn't get it done, is: "How are you
gonna use it?". Previously the way you create a new machine to run is:
```
mach := stackvm.New(prog, stackvm.HandlerFunc(func(*stackvm.Mach) { ...}))

// or if you don't need multiple results:
mach := stackvm.New(prog, nil)
```

Not much room to add an optional "this program wants these input values".
Right, an "obvious" case for using the go functional option pattern; so wanting
to write:
```
mach := stackvm.New(prog, stackvm.HandlerFunc(func(*stackvm.Mach) { ...}))

// no handler? nothing to do!
mach := stackvm.New(prog)

// input? sure!
mach := stackvm.New(prog, stackvm.Input([]uint32{99, 44, 100})
```

- [rename Handler types][21fb5f9c] to make room for `Handler` to be an optionator
- [then use them in `New()`][05d1bee1]

This leaves plenty of room for the future:
- specify queue size not just in the program
- injecting tracing concerns, rather than building them outsite the vm like
  `x/test.go` currently does
