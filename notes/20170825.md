Friday morning: A Sun Bursts Over The Horizon

Building on the tracelog JSON data from yesterday, a sunburst visualization
turns out to be quite promising:
- mouseover to highlight paths
- with a breadcrumb trail of ids at top
- can click an arc, and it opens the full log for that machine (and its parents
  up to fork) rendered nicely in an html table

[The whole thing's still a WIP][6c44a672], since I want make somethings better:
- choose more thoughtful coloring, rather than the cargoed (probably brewer?)
  colors I got for the gallery
- afford result machines vs error machines, so that you can easily find happy
  vs unhappy paths
- some "zooming" interaction on the sunburst, maybe: scrolling starts
  (un)limiting the dataset shown on the dial to be only down some prefix
- improve the log scrolling experience to be less jumpy
- some form of search
- do something with values at fork points, so you can retrodict value choices

As if all that wasn't enough, I also started refactoring the assembler (yes yet
again) to have a proper `type token struct` rather than (ab)using `stackvm.Op`
structs for everything.  [The initial result is VERY promising][7448b94f], the
assembler has much more breathing room now to do things like:
- make ".alloc" a single token, rather than N-many 0 data tokens
- add a ".align" token that tells the encoder to seek forward to a page
  boundary
