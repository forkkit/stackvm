Weekend roundup / Monday morning: 99% done with spans!

On dev, the tracelog viewer now shows the newly defined SMM spans with only two
(noticed!) bugs so far:
- the first column span isn't recognized
- the final `check___m` span doesn't end at the right place

Mundane code progress:
- finally gained enough confidence in [label generation][787dea59] [prep
  work][ef478eec] that's been carrying along in dev for ~11 days
- proving that no rabbit hole is ever too deep, [further generalized tracelog
  value parsing][b0e9105a] so that the frontend doesn't need to do [such
  hacks][45b3ec33]; [this is][b2d5bb6f] [the game][3028cdc6] [one
  chooses][be70e321] to play when one avoids using a standard log format, like
  JSON ;-)
- ported out and merged the [`refsBy` => `refs`][de220d00] speed boost, and
  [another alloc reduction][d456a69f] made ~4 days ago

Notable assembler refactor: now with other "label modifier" directives, it'd be
nice if we could combine them; e.g. the prior `".entry"` and the upcoming
`".spanOpen"` directives. To get that:
- factor out [scanner.handle][54008432] so that we can re-enter the top-end
  "handle a token" path
- [`handleEntry` needs to change state][9f9423d3] early to be safe for such re-entrancy
- then [`expectLabel` can conspire with `handleLabel`][ce01a342] so that
  - if A expects a label
  - and so does B
  - then we can compose A and B with A getting the label consumed by B
- I expect this means I should refactor the scanner do be more like a push down
  automaton, but I'm optimizing for `max(understandabily)` at present rather
  than `max(mathGeek)` ;-)

Next up, I suspect I'll be able to work through the remaining 1% of the
viewer's defect this week, if not tomorrow!
