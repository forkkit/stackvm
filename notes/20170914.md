Thursday morning: nearly done laying pipe for "semantic spans"

Not much merge-able code progress to link (a bit of prep linked below fwiw).
However I do have a prototype on the dev branch that:
- adds new machine options to annotate addresses as span open/close
- x/assembler now annotates all call/ret operations as span open/close; this
  should be able to obviate tracelog frontend's heuristic
- x/tracer now passes those new debug span annotations along in its log

Confusingly it's currently labeling halts as span close, missing the `ret`'s.
This either a bug, or a feature that I need to keep since: yes halts do
semantically end any/all open spans, but that a bounded enough sort of logic
that the frontend can do (whatever you were doing with open spans, wind it down
at machine end).

Anyhow, what code progress there is, mostly makes space for the new feature:
- [doc typo fixes and cleanups][b1146332]
- [reified scanner label handling][5a2509b3]
- [reified prog token add][4fbe3868] (the easier to add "are you a `ret`?" logic)
- [reified prog ref add][bb85de72] (the easier to add "are you a `call`?" logic)
- [refactored `addrLabels` into a `DebugInfo` interface][d945da97] (the better to hang more things on)
