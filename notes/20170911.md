Weekend roundup / Monday morning: Fantastic debug labels, and how to trace them

After finishing the snake unit tests, and still not having a working solution,
I set out with the goal of collapsing known good segments of the trace logs
(aka unit-tested function calls).

To do that I need to add a protocol for the assembler to pass a debug label
table to the mach builder, then provide some mechanism for using that table.
The VM itself has no use for it at runtime, so let's not impinge upon it.

But, as usual, before adding another feature to the assembler, more prep was
needed in it first. I won't bore you with minute refactor details, but
basically [section collection is now decoupled from the encoder][6cafcdab].

Next up, the machine builder:
- learned how to [read varints][6d6c5e58] [and strings][a41cd6cb]
- [added an `addrLabels` option protocol][a1a473f8] for the assembler to target
- and [a build option][ef8c5690] for the user to get the read table

All that token prep from days ago paid off:
- adding a [novel addrLabel token][d9c24b1f] turned out to be easy
- [then with][c09509fc] [a bit][85592104] [more][d8e3fc98] [refactoring][cdc3411e]
- adding a [separate section to collect addrLabels][8ff13007] was easy

Next another side path, hex dumps have never been well handled in tracelog:
- [now we parse notes out into the prior record][fa0f8622]
- after more prep that I have appetite for linking here...
- [notes are now shown in the log table][0a9c2122]

Right, back on task: [hookup addrLabels in x/test][2789a159] [and use it in x/tracer][1a6053f2].

Frontend time!
- [parse out the labels][ea11ae4d]
- ... refactoring
- [and augment the IP column with them][05444cd2]
- [fixed an edge case bug in the record assembler][35930f3c]

And I nearly finished through detecting and collapsing control stack spans,
before running out of time. I refactored SMM to use more internal function
calls (e.g. each column computation) so that I have a test data set of at least
depth-2 call stack to vet it out first... nott fully working yet.
