Wednesday morning: fixed the bug, almost there!

As it turns out op, ad especiall option, varcode size estimation has been
broken for some time:
- first off [make more parts of the assembler's token handling fail if
  unexpected things happen][32081b27]; I didn't actually encounter these, but
  they were "in the room" so to speak ([and another one too][fc58ff6d]).
- be sure to [always worst-case estimate every addrLabel token][47fa1e06] (had
  to first [define the worst case][0e50d60a])
- [fixed Op needed size logic][1741399d] for ops that take ref args (an
  eventually-resolved address or offset)
- [another insanity/defense-in-depth guard while we're at it][d8e378a2]
- and finally, [all that jazz for Option varcodes too][b4b4b3d1]

As the `TODO` in that final points out, we really need to reify and cleanup
"varcode dialects". In the beginning there were only op varcodes, and that
worked okay. Then came the option varcodes, and things seemed to work. But then
the option varcodes just kept growing in new and novel ways (the semantics
around `addrLabel` being the biggest stretch of all).

The span work isn't quite release ready yet:
- the adapted SMM test, while passing, is nearly ~2x slower on its benchmark;
  need to sort out what's going on there first
- plus I've not actually gotten time to even look at the new SMM output in the
  tracelog viewer yet to confirm it's right!
