Weekend roundup / Monday morning: it's all fun and games, and then an assembler bug!

Made a decent amount of progress over the weekend:
- the basic plumbing for span marking now works...
- ...in replacement for more fragile viewer-side call/ret detection
- ...and I can use it to mark the first 3 column computations in SMM
- ...but as soon as I use it to mark the 4th column, the vm crashes

Remember, "crash" means a very specific thing in stackvm:
- opcode 0 is the "crash" opcode...
- ...precisely so that if the VM tries to execute unallocated space, you get a
  very particualr halt error, a "crash"
- however in this case, it's not unallocated space; rather the assembler is
  tossing in the towel for some reason creating a truncated program ending in a
  sequence of `00`s ... huh?

So I dusetd off my `debug_asm` branch (assembler debug logging) from a few
weeks ago, and it showed the assembler encoding a "ret" instruction encoded as
a `0x00` right before halting ... wut? Well I nailed that down as a manual
`panic` check in `x/assemble` as a place to pick up tomorrow.

The good:
- the tracelog extractor now [tries hard to][de7a4dd5] [parse scanned values]
  [88b4d048] for json records
- this makes the [viewer's life way easier][107f9b10]
- [raw mode][56a96fd1] [got alot][c8748cae] [more raw][4a72e894]
- the tracelog [viewer now handles sub-spans more correctly][8acf181f]
- the tracelog [viewer now links pre- and post- ops][5a9bf87a]: 5a9bf87a6b541712639294870e4ba69210874eff sunburst RecordAssembler: link pre-op rec on each post-op rec
- the [tracer now adds explicit `opName` annotations][20083ce3]
- and the [viewer now uses them rather than more fragile regex logic][8d0e7315]

Next up:
- track down and fix this assembler bug
- finally finish out the span annotation work
- since the assembler debug log keeps being so uesful, try to sort out why it
  has an adverse performance impact when disabled, and ship it
