Thursday morning: small progress after a small break,

After taking two mornings off, I picked back up this morning trying to track
down why the `col_dey` span wasn't recognized in viewer:
- looking at raw mode (and indeed the pre-parsed test output) showed a total
  lack of annotation
- I decided to verify it from the bottom (assembler) first
  - while this turned out to be a dead end (there was no assembler bug)...
  - the assembler debug log now includes target names for [option][4e44a8ad] and [op][05af08fc] tokens.

As it turns out, my logic in the trace logger and the viewer itself was only
half sufficient:
- I originally thought I could get away with only annotated post-op opens and
  pre-op closes
- as seems "obvious" now, I need to annotate opens and closes on both halves to
  get this case
- ran out of time maybe ~70% of the way through working through that
  realization

Tomorrow: complete the now more general span open/close handling in the viewer.
