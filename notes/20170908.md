Friday morning: testing testing testing

Testing my way through snake's support code:
- [testing forall revealed][95c63a0a] that it's fully inclusive, and I had been
  using it like a half-open range in a few places; despite the modernity of the
  half-open design choice, going with full inclusive turns out to be simpler to
  implement in stackvm.
- [tested by index / x,y,z transformations][1a2e1a7a]
- [started testing my way through vec2addptr][b8971dbc]; the reverse case still
  fails, may be a bug there!

While doing that I found:
- that [the assembler had forgotten how to flag undefined labels][543ea110]
- and that [pushing 0 was harder than it needed to be][cc517989]

Next up:
- finish testing vec2addptr
- whether or not that's sufficient to fully fix snake, implement a debug symbol
  table. One of the best features of my prior register vm was that it's
  assembler provided a mapping of known ip -> label; this was then used by the
  tracer to annotate control flow operations
- to go further than that, once I have that sort of symbolication, the tracelog
  viewer can learn to do things like collapse sub-routines in the log table
  view.
