Tuesday morning: collapsible tracelog spans

Finished off using the new debug addr -> label mapping in the tracelog frontend:
- with [a bit][c570b699] [of prep][3d63fc73] out of the way
- we now [mine spans out of `call`/`ret` pairs][e38c58df]
- then we can [use them to show/hide table rows][d9738783]
- since I encountered [broken spans][90e59ece] while debugging the call/ret
  miner, the table can deal with that properly in case it happens other ways in
  the future
- nearly forgot to [accommodate these newly hidden rows in the focus scrolling mechanism][9730a633]

Next up:
- The way that I got a sufficiently interesting (nested calls) dataset to debug
  this way by modifying the SMM test...
- ...there-in I factored out routines for each column's "compute the third".
- That got me my data set, but it made the SMM solver ~40% slower (~1.4ms up
  from ~1ms)...
- ...that's not a bug, that's a (missing) feature!
- What this really points to is that we need more ways than just "call/ret"
  pairing to define spans; I started prototyping a new pair of `".span"` and
  `".endSpan"` directives for use in program text sections.
- This will allow authors to demarcate spans to ease debugging (or for a future
  optimizing compiler to mark inlined functions...)

I'm also considering taking a break to research other VMs, such as the classic
zork z-machine, or the ink/kni curiosity; however I do want to take another run
at tieing off this snake-cube solution of mine first...
